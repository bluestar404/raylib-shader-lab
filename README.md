# raylib-shader-lab
A collection of experimental shaders and visual effects built with Raylib. Includes real-time effects like grass sway, reflective water, glowing sun, neon trails, fire distortion, and more. This project is a sandbox for testing and learning fragment shaders, GPU animation, and smooth visual transitions â€” all without external assets.
